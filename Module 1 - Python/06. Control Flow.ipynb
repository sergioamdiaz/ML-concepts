    "\n",
    "Control flow refers to the order that statements are executed in Python. The previous chapters have all had statements execute one after another in the order that they were written. This chapter will cover **if** statements and iteration, the two most basic categories of how control flow gets manipulated by the programmer.\n",

    "## Indenting and code blocks in Python\n",
    "Python's syntax is so simple that it relies upon **indentation** (and not curly braces like in other languages) beneath code blocks to mark their beginning and end. `if, for, while, def, with` are all statements that have indented code blocks underneath them. A block is ended when the indentation for the current line returns to where it was before the indentation began. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), a popular python style guide suggests 4 spaces (not tabs) for indentation. Jupyter notebooks default to 4 spaces as well and take care of it for you when you begin a code block that requires indentation."

    "## Case Study: Calculating $\\pi$\n",
    "An interesting way to calculate the value of $\\pi$ uses random numbers and the unit circle. This next section will introduce plotting code that will not be explained in detail. The point of this case study is to highlight the usefulness of looping in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Matplotlib to draw the unit circle\n",
    "Matplotlib is the predominant plotting library in Python and what we will use during the bootcamp. We will import the library and use it to display plots for us inside the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin by drawing the unit circle, radius of 1 centered at (0,0), inside of a square with side length of 2 also centered at (0,0)."
